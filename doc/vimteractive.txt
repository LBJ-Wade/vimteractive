1. Intro                                                  *vimteractive-intro*

Vimteractive was inspired by the workflow of the vim-ipython plugin:

    https://github.com/ivanov/vim-ipython

This plugin is designed to extend a subset of the functionality of vimteractive
to other interpreters (including ipython). This plugin is designed to extend a
subset of the functionality of vim-ipython to other interpreters (including
ipython). It is based around the unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it
well".  It aims to provide a robust and simple link between text files and
interactive interpreters. Vimteractive will never aim to do things like
autocompletion, leaving that to other, more developed tools such as
YouCompleteMe.

The activating commands are 
- ipython |:Iipython| 
- python  |:Ipython| 
- julia   |:Ijulia|
- maple   |:Imaple|
- bash    |:Ibash|
- clojure |:Iclojure|
- zsh     |:Izsh|

You can also let Vimteractive detect interpreter using |:Iterm|

Commands may be sent from a text file to the chosen terminal using CTRL-S. 
See |v_CTRL_S| for more details.

Since this package leverages the native vim interactive terminal, it is 
only compatible with vim 8 or greater.

2. Usage                                                  *vimteractive-usage*

To use the key-bindings, you should first disable the CTRL-S default, which is
a terminal command to freeze the output. You can disable this by putting

stty -ixon

into your .bashrc (or equivalent shell profile file)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example usage:

Create a python file vimteractive_test.py with the following content:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    x = numpy.linspace(-2,2,1000)
    y = x**3-x
    ax.plot(x, y)
    ax.set_xlabel('$x$')
    ax.set_ylabel('$y$')

Now start an ipython interpreter in vim with :Iipython. You should see a
preview window open above with your ipython prompt. Position your cursor over
the first line of vimteractive_test.py, and press  CTRL-S. You should see this
line now appear in the first prompt of the preview window. Do the same with
the second and fourth lines. At the fourth line, you should see a figure
appear once it's constructed with plt.subplots(). Continue by sending lines to
the interpreter. You can send multiple lines by doing a visual selection and
pressing CTRL-S.

If you switch windows with CTRL-W k, you will see the terminal buffer switch
to a more usual looking normal-mode buffer, from which you can perform
traditional normal mode commands. However, if you try to insert, you will
enter the terminal, and be able to enter commands interactively into the
prompt as if you had run it in the command line. You can save this buffer if
you wish to a new file if it contains valuable output


Supported terminals                                   *vimteractive-terminals*

*:Iipython* 	Activate an ipython terminal
*:Ipython*  	Activate a python terminal
*:Ijulia*   	Activate a julia terminal
*:Imaple*   	Activate a maple terminal
*:Ibash*    	Activate a bash terminal
*:Izsh*     	Activate a zsh terminal
*:Iclojure*		Activate a clojure terminal
*:Iterm*		Activate a terminal based on current filetype

Sending commands                                                    *v_CTRL_S*

CTRL-S sends lines of text to the interpreter in a mode-dependent manner:

In |Normal-mode|, CTRL-S sends the line currently occupied by the cursor
the terminal.

In |Insert-mode|, CTRL-S sends the line currently being edited, and then
returns to insert mode at the same location.

In |Visual-mode|, CTRL-S sends all currently selected lines to the terminal.

ALT-S sends all lines from the start to the current line.

3. Extending functionality                            *vimteractive-extending*

To add a new interpreter to Vimteractive, you should define
g:vimteractive_commands variable. For example:

	let g:vimteractive_commands = { 'pythonasync': 'python -m asyncio' }

will provide you :Ipythonasync command starting Python 3.8+ asyncio REPL.
If you want to make this command default for python filetype, you should do

	let g:vimteractive_default_shells = { 'python': 'pythonasync' }

If you see escape sequences appearing when you do CTRL-S for your interpreter,
you may try to disable bracketed paste mode for it:

	let g:vimteractive_bracketed_paste = { 'pythonasync': 0 }
